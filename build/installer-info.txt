Welcome to the eTA© installer.

eTA© is a learning tool which helps students to improve their 
reading speed and comprehension with number of functions to help 
prepare for tests.

The eTA© is implemented based on an open-source project named 
Mary (Modular Architecture for Research on speed sYnthesis).  
It is developed on Netbeans IDE 6.1 and exploits Java Desktop 
Application template and Java Swing components for designing user 
interface. 

The software is based on traditional speed reading principles, 
text mining techniques and a proprietary reinforcement technique 
currently underdevelopment.  The graphic user interface allows the 
student to more efficiently mark and take notes on important parts
of the reading material.  It also generates a content analysis 
report based on 
1) the student’s highlighted words and phrases; 
2) the student’s notes and 
3) the content analyzer.  The content analyzer gives a word count 
of important names and key concepts and a vector context of these 
words and names.
